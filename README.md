Given the relevance of education in the economic development of a territory, the question 
arises about which factors influence the attainment of a high educational level and, consequently, 
the generation of better opportunities for human development. In order to provide possible answers 
to this issue, this thesis aims to determine the influence of social and economic factors that 
particularly affect the inhabitants of Metropolitan Lima during the years 2016-2019. The present 
research is framed within a basic and explanatory approach, as it seeks to explain the relationship 
between socioeconomic variables (gender, ethnic group, occupation, number of household 
members, number of sleeping rooms in the dwelling, and socioeconomic status) and educational 
variables (primary, secondary, and tertiary education levels), using a hypothetical-deductive 
method. Consequently, the following hypotheses were tested: a) with greater development of 
economic factors, the inhabitants of Metropolitan Lima will achieve a higher educational level, 
and b) with greater development of social factors, the inhabitants of Metropolitan Lima will have 
a higher educational level. The theoretical foundations considered for this testing are those that 
explain the contribution of human capital and human development to the improvement of 
education. The selected model used for analysis is the multinomial logit model, which allows 
analyzing the influence of the variables on the educational levels of primary, secondary, and 
tertiary education. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate the influence of the majority of the 
analyzed variables on the educational level. However, the significance of some variables is biased 
due to the size of the sample used.
